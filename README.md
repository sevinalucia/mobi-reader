MOBI Reader is a simple and powerful extension that can open any document with a mobi (or kindle) file extension.

Please right-click on any ".mobi" link and then click on the - View MOBI - item from the context menu. Alternatively, you can open the popup window and then add the mobi link in the UI to view the document. For offline files, simply drag the file to the designated area in the popup to load the mobi document. This add-on has a dark mode to better read mobi files at night time. Moreover, you can resize the window to your desired size and the document will adapt itself to the new size.

Note 1: MOBI is a new e-book file format for viewing online or offline documents. MOBI file format is designed for Kindle devices and created by Amazon company.
Note 2: this add-on uses an open-source JavaScript library called mobi.js to render the ".mobi" file format (https://github.com/woshifyz/mobi_reader/blob/master/mobi.js).
